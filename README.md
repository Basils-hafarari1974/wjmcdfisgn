so i just got out of Final DestinAtiON: Bloodlines, right?? my head’s buzzing like a beehive on espresso shots, man. theater was packed, could barely step over those sticky popcorn landmines on the ground. i think my back might’ve fused to the seat lol — think gravity forgot to let me float.

but the  … wow, it’s a rollercoaster without the safety bar. like, i swear, i haven’t clenched so hard since… dunno, maybe my last dentist appointment?? it was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a squirrel try to skydive without a parachute. unpredictable and almost silly in its madness, but you can't stop 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨.

> atm i’m just thnking ‘bout that bathroom scene — mirrors shattering like they’re screamin’ in slow motion. reminded me why i hate public restrooms. i mean, i've always suspected they had a vendetta against me; this   just confirmed it!

remember how someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or something — geez, who was that? — forget 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨, you gotta see it on the big screen, feel the panic like 3D fishhooks dragging at your nerves. touching on some family curse or what?? they’re jumping timelines as casually as flipping TV channels — cerebral gymnastics are a prerequisite, i guess.

this guy—can’t remember his name—looked like he had a permanent question mark over his head throughout the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. like, how many existential crises can a dude have before breakfast? guessing none of us should mess with destiny, or even jaywalk under its 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩ful eyes, tbh.  

climactic moments stitched together like a patchwork quilt from grandma’s attic; eerie, yet warm and nostalgic? haha dunno why it makes me think of musty quilts, but there it is. my brain logic’s apparently gone holidaying in Bermuda.

wait—there’s the bit with the runaway car—no spoilers but grannies are wild behind the wheel here. like geriatrics on red bull or something. 

yeah sure, you could 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with that person from work who wanted to share it... they’re in for a wild ride, definitely. 

uh, does that cover it? i can't even tell, this   scrambled my radar.

int justRandomCode = 42;
console.writeLine(whyDidIPasteThisHere); // oops
if (mind == scattered) {
    return;
}
